# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Phase 1: Foundation & Structure Implementation**
- Building SvelteKit-based website architecture with "Her" aesthetic
- Creating comprehensive memory bank documentation for Svelte approach
- Establishing reusable component system and routing foundation
- Setting up responsive navigation and global layout system

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Complete Rewrite
- **projectbrief.md**: Updated for SvelteKit approach and portfolio focus
- **productContext.md**: Refined for career positioning and book journal goals
- **techContext.md**: Complete SvelteKit technology stack documentation
- **systemPatterns.md**: Component architecture and implementation patterns
- **activeContext.md**: Current status and immediate next steps

### Project Transition Analysis
- Transitioned from React to SvelteKit for simpler development
- Confirmed clean SvelteKit foundation with modern tooling
- Identified 7-page structure: Home, Linguistics, Teaching, Music, Portfolio, Writing, About
- Planned "Her" aesthetic implementation with detailed style guide

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Current Session)
1. **Global Layout Setup**: Create +layout.svelte with navigation and "Her" aesthetic
2. **Core Components**: Build Card.svelte, Hero.svelte, and Navigation.svelte
3. **CSS Foundation**: Implement "Her" aesthetic variables and typography system
4. **Page Structure**: Create all 7 main routes with placeholder content
5. **Basic Routing**: Test navigation and ensure all routes work correctly

### Short-term Goals (Next Sessions)
1. **Content Integration**: Add real achievements from resume and background
2. **Writing System**: Implement JSON-based blog with dynamic routing
3. **Visual Polish**: Refine "Her" aesthetic implementation and interactions
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure responsive design works across devices

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Site Structure Decision
**Final Structure**: 7 main pages with clean navigation
- **Home**: Current Moffitt role + brief overview
- **Linguistics**: Research, publications, conferences, academic work
- **Teaching**: Education experience, Fulbright achievement, philosophy
- **Music**: Performance, education, recordings, creative work
- **Portfolio**: Coding projects, tools, technical accomplishments
- **Writing**: Book reflections with dynamic routing and JSON management
- **About**: Personal story, detailed background, contact information

### Technical Approach Decisions
- **SvelteKit**: File-based routing with simple component architecture
- **CSS Strategy**: "Her" aesthetic with custom properties and traditional CSS
- **Content Management**: Source code editing with JSON for writing section
- **Component Philosophy**: Reusable Card and Hero components across all sections

### Content Philosophy
- **"Less Text, More Impact"**: Each achievement in 1-3 sentences maximum
- **Card-based Presentation**: Consistent visual format across all sections
- **Portfolio Focus**: Positioning for future career opportunities and PhD applications
- **Personal Touch**: Book journal for intellectual depth and ongoing reflection

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Component Organization
```
src/
├── routes/                    # SvelteKit file-based routing
│   ├── +layout.svelte        # Global layout
│   ├── +page.svelte          # Home page
│   ├── [section]/+page.svelte # Individual sections
│   └── writing/              # Dynamic routing for posts
├── lib/
│   ├── components/           # Reusable components
│   └── styles/               # CSS organization
```

### "Her" Aesthetic Implementation
- **Color Palette**: Cream backgrounds (#F4F0E9), charcoal text (#3A3232), red accents (#D95B43)
- **Typography**: Lora serif for headings, Inter sans-serif for body text
- **Effects**: Blurred backgrounds, subtle hover animations, generous whitespace
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design starting with mobile experience

### Content Data Patterns
```javascript
const achievement = {
  title: "Achievement Title",
  description: "1-3 sentence impact description",
  link: "optional-url",
  date: "optional-date"
};
```

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technology Choice Validation
SvelteKit provides the simplicity Larry wanted while maintaining modern web development capabilities. File-based routing eliminates complex configuration.

### Content Strategy Clarity
The "less text, more impact" philosophy aligns perfectly with card-based presentation. Visitors can quickly scan achievements without overwhelming detail.

### Aesthetic Implementation
The detailed "Her" style guide provides clear direction for consistent visual implementation across all components and pages.

### Maintenance Simplicity
Source code editing for content updates maintains Larry's desired simplicity while providing full control over presentation and organization.

## Current Challenges

### Component Design Balance
Creating components flexible enough for different content types while maintaining visual consistency across all sections.

### Content Prioritization
Balancing comprehensive background showcase with clean, scannable presentation requires careful achievement selection and description crafting.

### Writing System Implementation
Building dynamic routing for book reflections while maintaining the simplicity of JSON-based content management.

## Project Context Reminders

- **Primary Goal**: Portfolio website for future career opportunities (2-3 years out)
- **Key Constraint**: No database - all content managed through source code
- **Design Vision**: "Her" movie aesthetic with warm, retro-futuristic styling
- **Content Philosophy**: "Less text, more impact" with 1-3 sentence achievements
- **Maintenance Priority**: Easy updates through direct file editing
