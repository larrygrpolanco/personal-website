# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Phase 1: Skeleton Structure Creation**
- Building foundational website architecture with Vite + React
- Creating comprehensive memory bank documentation
- Establishing component structure and routing foundation
- Setting up responsive navigation system

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Creation
- **projectbrief.md**: Core project requirements and vision
- **productContext.md**: User experience goals and success metrics
- **systemPatterns.md**: Technical architecture and component relationships
- **techContext.md**: Technology stack and development patterns
- **activeContext.md**: Current status and immediate next steps

### Project Setup Analysis
- Examined existing Vite + React boilerplate
- Confirmed clean foundation with React 19.1.0 and modern tooling
- Identified need for React Router installation
- Planned component directory structure

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Current Session)
1. **Install React Router**: Add routing capability for multi-page navigation
2. **Create Directory Structure**: Set up organized component and page folders
3. **Build Layout Components**: Header, Navigation, Footer with responsive design
4. **Implement Basic Routing**: Set up routes for all main sections
5. **Create Page Skeletons**: Basic structure for Home, Research, Teaching, Creative, Writing, About

### Short-term Goals (Next Sessions)
1. **Content Integration**: Add real content from resume and personal background
2. **Personal Vignettes**: Create components for small personal stories
3. **Responsive Testing**: Ensure mobile-first design works across devices
4. **Navigation Polish**: Smooth hamburger menu and active state handling

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Navigation Structure Decision
**Final Structure**: 6 main pages with clean top navigation
- **Home**: Current role prominence + brief overview
- **Research**: Linguistics work, publications, conferences
- **Teaching**: Education experience, Fulbright achievement
- **Creative**: Music + Programming (combined for flexibility)
- **Writing**: Book reflections, personal essays
- **About**: Personal story, detailed background, contact

### Technical Approach Decisions
- **CSS Strategy**: Traditional CSS with descriptive class names + custom properties
- **React Patterns**: Simple functional components with educational comments
- **Mobile Navigation**: Hamburger menu that transforms top navigation
- **Content Flexibility**: Modular components for easy reorganization

### Design Philosophy
- **Skeleton First**: Build clean structure before aesthetic implementation
- **Future-Ready**: Architecture supports "Her" movie aesthetic vision
- **Educational**: Code includes learning-focused comments and explanations
- **Personal Touch**: Space for vignettes and personal moments throughout

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Component Organization
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Layout/          # Header, Navigation, Footer
│   ├── Sections/        # ContentSection, HeroSection
│   └── Common/          # Reusable UI components
├── pages/               # Route-based page components
├── styles/              # CSS with component documentation
└── assets/              # Images, documents, icons
```

### CSS Class Naming Convention
- Descriptive, semantic names (`.hero-section`, `.nav-primary`)
- Component-specific prefixes (`.home-hero`, `.research-grid`)
- State classes (`.nav-open`, `.active-link`)
- Responsive modifiers (`.mobile-only`, `.desktop-grid`)

### React Learning Focus
- **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs from simple pieces
- **Props Passing**: Clean data flow between components
- **Functional Components**: Modern React with hooks
- **Best Practices**: Clean, readable, maintainable code patterns

## Learnings and Project Insights

### User Requirements Clarity
Larry's vision is clear: prioritize aesthetics and clean navigation over complex functionality. The "Her" movie aesthetic inspiration provides strong design direction for future phases.

### Content Strategy Understanding
The multifaceted background requires careful balance - showcase diversity without overwhelming visitors. Personal vignettes will be key to creating emotional connection.

### Technical Simplicity Value
Keeping React patterns simple serves dual purpose: easier maintenance and better learning experience. Traditional CSS approach provides flexibility for future theming.

### Flexibility Importance
Larry emphasized content reorganization needs - the modular component approach will support changing priorities and interests over time.

## Current Challenges

### Content Prioritization
Balancing comprehensive background showcase with clean, non-overwhelming presentation requires careful information architecture.

### Aesthetic Vision Implementation
"Her" movie aesthetic is inspiring but complex - need to build foundation that can accommodate warm, retro-futuristic, intimate styling.

### React Learning Integration
Providing educational value without over-complicating the codebase requires thoughtful commenting and pattern selection.

## Project Context Reminders

- **Primary Goal**: Clean, aesthetically excellent personal website
- **Key Constraint**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Future Vision**: Warm, retro-futuristic aesthetic inspired by "Her" movie
- **Learning Objective**: React skill development with best practices
- **Flexibility Need**: Easy content reorganization as priorities evolve
