2. Implement JSON-based writing system with dynamic routing
3. Create PostList.svelte component for writing index
4. Build individual post pages with [slug] routing
5. Refine all content for maximum impact and clarity

## Known Technical Considerations

### SvelteKit Implementation
- **File-based Routing**: Leverage SvelteKit's built-in routing system
- **Component Architecture**: Build reusable components with consistent patterns
- **CSS Organization**: Global variables with component-scoped styles
- **Content Management**: Source code editing with JSON for writing section

### "Her" Aesthetic Implementation
- **Color System**: CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- **Typography**: Google Fonts integration (Lora + Inter)
- **Effects**: Blurred backgrounds, subtle animations, generous whitespace
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with logical breakpoints

### Content Management Strategy
- **Achievement Data**: Embedded arrays in component files for easy editing
- **Writing Posts**: JSON file with structured post data
- **Dynamic Routing**: SvelteKit [slug] routing for individual posts
- **No Database**: Maintain simplicity with file-based content

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Technology Stack Evolution
**Original**: Vite + React with complex component patterns
**Current**: SvelteKit with simple, reusable component architecture
**Reasoning**: Larry wanted simplicity and ease of maintenance over complex functionality

### Content Strategy Evolution
**Original**: Detailed descriptions and lengthy content sections
**Current**: "Less text, more impact" with 1-3 sentence achievements
**Reasoning**: Focus on portfolio effectiveness and visitor time respect

### Site Structure Evolution
**Original**: 6 pages with combined creative section
**Current**: 7 pages with separate Portfolio and Music sections
**Reasoning**: Better organization of coding projects vs. creative work

### Design Approach Evolution
**Original**: General "Her" aesthetic inspiration
**Current**: Detailed style guide with specific implementation patterns
**Reasoning**: Ensure consistent visual implementation and LLM guidance
