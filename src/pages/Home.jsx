              I'm a research professional with a unique background spanning linguistics, 
              education, music, and programming. Currently starting my journey at Moffitt 
              Cancer Center as a Research Project Specialist, where I'll apply my skills 
              in data management, process automation, and stakeholder coordination to 
              support critical cancer research.
            </p>
            <p className="overview-text">
              My diverse experience includes published linguistics research, Fulbright 
              teaching in Taiwan, music education, and developing automation tools for 
              research workflows. I believe this multifaceted background brings a unique 
              perspective to collaborative research environments.
