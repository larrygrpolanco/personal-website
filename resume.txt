Cover letter
Dear Moffitt Hiring Team,
I am writing to express my deep interest in the Research Project Specialist position. Moffitt holds personal
significance for me, having supported family and friends through their treatment, and I've long admired its
dedication to research. As I prepare to complete my Fulbright grant commitment in June 2025, I have been

reflecting on my career path which has taken me from music to research. I am at a point where I want a long-
term career that aligns with my values, my ability, and allows me to learn and grow right here in Tampa.

I own way too many succulents. They take patience, attention, consistency, and understanding how small
adjustments make a big difference over time. I like to approach work similarly, with dedication and a focus on
creating organized, robust, and easy-to-follow systems. My diverse background, including automating data
workflows at Rightpath and managing adaptable logistics for multi-city volunteer programs in Taiwan, has
taught me how to optimize processes and manage details effectively to support larger goals.
While not a clinical scientist by training, I excel at the operational backbone of research: organizing complex
information, solving logistical puzzles, and building efficient, functional structures. I value collaboration; I really
enjoyed the weekly deep dives with researchers at Rightpath to ensure the data was exactly what they needed
and appreciated the friendships we developed. The core skills required for this role, meticulous data handling,
coordinating project activities, and documenting procedures, are ones I have actively developed and genuinely
enjoy applying.
I'm at a point where I'm ready to commit to a long-term career, and this role at Moffitt feels like the right place
to do that. I'm eager to bring my skills in data and process to support your critical research. I also bring a strong
foundation in building rapport and communicating clearly, through my time as an educator, which I believe is
vital. Just as importantly, I'm ready to fully commit to a long-term career at Moffitt, eager to learn the specifics
of endocrine oncology and acquire any certifications or training needed. I'm confident I can grow significantly in
this position.
Thank you for considering my path and genuine interest. I welcome the chance to discuss how my dedication
and experience can support your research efforts.
